# JBA Project - Chatbot

## 1st step
Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

## 2nd step
The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality.

## 3rd step
Keep improving your bot by developing new skills for it. We suggest a simple guessing game that will predict the age of a user.

It's based on a simple math trick. First, take a look at this formula:

```bash
age = (remainder3 * 70 + remainder5 * 21 + remainder7 * 15) % 105
```

The numbers remainder3, remainder5, and remainder7 are the remainders of division by 3, 5 and 7 respectively.

It turns out that for each number ranging from 0 to 104, the calculation will result in the number itself. This perfectly fits the ordinary age range, doesn't it? Ask the user for the remainders and use them to guess the age!

## 4th step
In this stage, you will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number users enter.

## 5th step
In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming. At the final stage, you will improve your simple bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be a multiple-choice quiz about programming. Your bot has to repeat the test until you answer correctly and congratulate you upon completion.
